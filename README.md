## OBJECTIVE:
### Our objective is to perform ETL on various data sets to be able to analyze the difference in average attendance in sporting events for large market cities versus small market cities, how average attendance has changed over time in the cities and how demographic/economical change in those cities plays a factor.

## DATA SOURCES:

Our data sources are:
   - **ESPN** - Sporting event attendance data
   - **St. Louis Fed** - Case-Shiller Home Price Index
   - **U.S. Census** - American Community Survey
   - **U.S. Department of Commerce** - Bureau of Economic Analysis - Regional Economic Accounts
   - **Wikipedia** - list of teams by metropolitan area

## DATA CLEANUP AND TRANSFORMATION:

   We will utilize Python pandas for our data transformation and will load the transformed data into PostgreSQL.

## PROJECT REPORT:

Our project report will include:
   - our raw data files from its various sources
   - our transformation jupyter notebook .ipynb files with comments explaining transformation process
   - our final PostgreSQL table(s) in schema.sql form
